#Visual Product Matcher
This project is a single-page web application that allows users to find visually similar products based on an uploaded image. It's built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive, and mobile-friendly user interface.

#Key Features
Dual Image Upload: Supports both local file uploads and direct image URL submissions.

Client-Side Visual Search: Implements a simulated visual search by generating and comparing color histograms of images directly in the browser. This provides a fast, backend-free demonstration of the core concept.

Similarity Ranking: Displays a list of products from a pre-defined catalog, sorted by how visually similar they are to the user's input image.

Interactive Filtering: Includes a slider that allows users to filter the results based on the calculated similarity score.

User-Friendly Interface: Features a clean design with clear loading states and error handling for a smooth user experience.

The product data used in this application is a sample subset from the "Fashion Product Images (Small)" dataset available on Kaggle.
